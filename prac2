B. Windows Command Line Utilities
1. Ping: Ping is a command-line utility, available on virtually any operating system
with network connectivity, that acts as a test to see if a networked device is
reachable. The ping command sends a request over the network to a specific
device.

## ping facebook.com
## ping facebook.com -i 15 -n l
## ping facebook.com -f -l 1452

Get the Public IP of the given domain. Check the size of the packet which can be
receive by the destination.

Check how much TTL router would take to discard the packet.

2. Tracert using Ping

3. Tracert : Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time
the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to
destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in
between. Traceroute also records the time taken for each hop the packet
makes during its route to the destination.
