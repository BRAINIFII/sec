To carry out this lab, you will require the following:
1. Kali Linux as the attacker machine
2. Web browser with Internet connection
3. Administrative privileges

You can crack a wireless network encrypted with WPA by using the following steps.
1. Log in to Kali Linux and launch the command terminal

2. First, check if the wireless card is connected or not by using the ‘iwconfig’ command, as shown in
Figure

3. Change the wireless interface into monitor mode using ‘airmon-ng start wlan0’ command with
wlan0 as your wireless interface name, as shown in Figure

4. Use ‘airodump’ to find out the SSID on the interface using the command:
‘airodump-ng -write capture wlan0’

5. Use the following command to capture a 4-way handshake by using airmon-ng to monitor traffic on
the target network using the channel and BSSID values
‘airodump-ng -c 3 --bssid 9C:5C:XX:XX:XX:XX -w . wlan0’
where, ‘-c 3’ is used to specify the channel number 3

6. Now, wait to capture the handshake packet. Once you have captured a packet, you will see the
output similar to Figure

7. You will see a captured .cap file in your /root location which is a default location

8. Now, run this captured file against a wordlist to crack the WPA key
