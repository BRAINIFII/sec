following steps:
1. Login to Kali Linux machine.

2. Go to Applications -> Kali Linux -> Web Applications -> Web Crawlers -> dirbuster to launch DirBuster as shown in Figure 1.

When it is launched, it opens in a GUI as shown in Figure 2

3. Type the URL of the website you want to scan in the Target URL text field and the port number, as shown in Figure 3.

4. Click on List Info to open a wordlist to be used to find the directories and files as shown in Figure 4.

When you click on List Info, it opens a Brute Forcing List Information window listing all
the available wordlists with a short description, as shown in Figure 5.

GET requests and sending them to the selected URL with a request for each of the files
and directories listed in the wordlist. Figure 8 shows the scan information.
