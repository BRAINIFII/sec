To test a website for SQL injection vulnerability, perform the following steps:
1. Log in to Kali Linux.

2. Open a web browser and enter the URL of the website you want to exploit, as shown
in Figure 1.

If a URL, for example http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1,has a GET
parameter as cat=1, then it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

3. You can check if your website is vulnerable by replacing the value 1 with * in GET
parameter. If the website results in an error as shown in Figure 2, then it is
vulnerable.

4. Open Terminal in Kali Linux as shown in Figure 3

5. Type sqlmap -h and press Enter to view the help and the list of parameters passed in
the SQLMAP, as shown in Figure 4.

6. Type the following command and press Enter to list the information about the
existing databases, as shown in Figure 5(a), Figure 5(b) and Figure 5(c).
sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 –dbs
Enter N when SQLMAP asks to skip payload for other databases except for the
detected database.
Enter N again when SQLMAP asks to include all tests.

In output part-3, you can see the executed payloads, available databases and backend
database version.

7. Type the following command and press Enter to list information about tables present
in a particular database, as shown in Figure 6(a):

sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart – tables
Figure 6(a) and 6(b) displays the output.

In Figure 6(b), you can see that there are eight tables.

8. Type the following command and press Enter to list information about the columns
of a particular table, as shown in Figure 7(a):
sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T artists
–columns
Figure 7(a) and 7(b) displays the output

9. Type the following command and press Enter to dump the data from the columns, as
shown in Figure 8(a):
sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T artists -
C aname –dump
Figure 8(a) and 8(b) displays the output.
